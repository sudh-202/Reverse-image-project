# Simple Image Search Engine

## Overview
- Simple image-based image search engine using Keras + Flask. You can launch the search engine just by running two python scripts.
- `offline.py`: This script extracts a deep-feature from each database image. Each feature is a 4096D fc6 activation from a VGG16 model with ImageNet pre-trained weights.
- `server.py`: This script runs a web-server. You can send your query image to the server via a Flask web-interface. The server finds similar images to the query by a simple linear scan.
- GPUs are not required.
- Tested on Ubuntu 18.04 and WSL2 (Ubuntu 20.04)
